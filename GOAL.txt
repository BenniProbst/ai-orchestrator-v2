# Example Goal: REST API Implementation

## Description
Create a basic REST API for task management with CRUD operations.
This is an example goal file demonstrating the format.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create project structure with proper directories

- [ ] Implement POST endpoint for creating tasks
- [ ] Implement PUT endpoint for updating tasks
- [ ] Implement DELETE endpoint for removing tasks
- [ ] Add input validation for all endpoints
- [ ] Write tests for all endpoints

## Quality Requirements
- All endpoints must return proper HTTP status codes
- Error responses must include meaningful messages
- Code must be well-documented
- Tests must achieve >80% coverage

## Constraints
- Use Python with Flask or FastAPI
- Use in-memory storage (no database required)
